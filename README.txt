Hello Pencil Learning Technologies,

My name is Zeyad Moustafa. In this repository, you will find 2 models. The main model is built with the specification mentioned in the project. The alternate model is a 
custom made moel I built to get better performance. The prediction code for each is provided.

I am so sorry I could not host the model as the model weights of the main model amounted to 1.15 Gb which is more than the allowed size in Google Colab.

I commented my thought processes and steps in building each of the models. If you have any questions regarding the models or prepreocessing please feel 
free to contact me through email.

Thank you so much for reviewing this project, looking forward to hearing from you.
